  <h1>Ticketless – Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Ticketless helps you avoid parking tickets by detecting when you park and checking nearby parking restrictions. 
     To provide this functionality, the app uses your location, motion data, and device sensors strictly for real-time detection.</p>

  <h2>Information The App Uses</h2>
  <p><strong>Location Data:</strong> Ticketless uses your precise location in the foreground and background to detect when you park
     and determine parking rules for your current block.</p>
  <p><strong>Motion & Fitness:</strong> Motion data is used to help detect when you leave your vehicle and reduce false alerts.</p>
  <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> Anonymous diagnostic data (like crashes or performance issues) may be collected to improve reliability.</p>

  <h2>How The App Uses Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect when and where you’ve parked</li>
    <li>Check nearby street cleaning, time limits, and tow-away zones</li>
    <li>Send alerts about upcoming restrictions</li>
    <li>Improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Do NOT Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> sell your data</li>
    <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> share your data with third parties</li>
    <li>The app does <strong>not</strong> store your location history on any server</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Your parking data and movement events are processed on-device and not stored on external servers. 
     Any anonymous analytics collected through TestFlight or Apple is controlled by Apple.</p>
